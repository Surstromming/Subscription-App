# Subscription App

1. Install the dependencies with `yarn`
2. Start the build assets and start the server with `yarn start`.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:3030`.
4. You'll also need to have MySQL running on you local environment, and upload the dumpfile there, use the credentials described in '/server/controllers/subscription-controller.js' or replace them with your own.
